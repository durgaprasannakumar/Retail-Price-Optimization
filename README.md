# Retail-Price-Optimization
Implementing a retail price optimization algorithm using regression trees
 
# About the project problem
Pricing a product is a crucial aspect in any business. A lot of thought process is put into it. There are different strategies to price different kinds of products. There are products whose sales are quite sensitive to their prices and as such a small change in their price can lead to noticeable change in their sales. 
Price elasticity of demand (Epd), or elasticity, is the degree to which the effective desire for something changes as its price changes. In general, people desire things less as those things become more expensive. However, for some products, the customers desire could drop sharply even with a little price increase, and for other products, it could stay almost the same even with a big price increase. Economists use the term elasticity to denote this sensitivity to price increases. More precisely, price elasticity gives the percentage change in quantity demanded when there is a one percent increase in price, holding everything else constant.

In  pricing optimization case study, we will take the data of a cafe and based on their past sales, identify the optimal prices for their items based on the price elasticity of the items. For each item, first the price elasticity will be calculated and then the optimal price will be figured.
